## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Clarify

Clarify is a personal productivity and project-clarification tool built with Laravel. It helps you quickly capture ideas, clarify them, turn them into actionable projects, and track your progressâ€”all in one place.

## Features
- **Ideas Inbox:** Quick capture of ideas (title, notes, tags), link ideas, clarify context, mark as ready for projects.
- **Project Builder:** Convert ideas to projects, define features and tasks, add tags/categories, track progress.
- **Logs:** Daily journal, future idea dump, and project progress logs.
- **Calendar View:** Assign tasks to time blocks and visualize your schedule.

## How It Works
1. **Capture ideas** as they come to you.
2. **Clarify** ideas by adding context (problem, audience, solution).
3. **Link** related ideas together.
4. **Convert** ready ideas into projects.
5. **Break down** projects into features and tasks.
6. **Track progress** and log your journey.
7. **Organize** everything with tags and categories.

## Project Structure
- See `plan.md` for a full overview of entities, relationships, and feature flow.
- See `TODO.md` for a step-by-step development checklist.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `composer install && npm install`
3. Set up your `.env` file and database
4. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
5. Start the server: `php artisan serve`

## Learning Goals
This project is designed to help you learn Laravel by building a real-world, multi-feature app from scratch, focusing on server-rendered Blade views and core Laravel concepts.
